## About The Project

Git AI CLI automates the generation of commit messages using AI, based on your staged changes.

- **AI-Powered Commit Messages:** Automatically generate meaningful commit messages based on the changes you've staged, reducing the time spent writing commits manually.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Guide the AI by providing your own messages, allowing for more precise and contextually relevant commit messages.
- **Edit Before Commit:** Review and edit the generated commit message before finalizing the commit, giving you full control over the final output.
- **Model Configuration:** Easily configure and override the AI model used for generating commit messages, adapting to your specific needs.
- **Debug Mode:** Enable detailed logging with the --debug flag to gain insights into the commit generation process, helpful for troubleshooting and understanding the AI's behavior.

## Installation

First, download and install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

```bash
npm install -g git-ai-cli
```

That's all you need to start! ðŸŽ‰
